# odin-recipes
Working on basic webapges as part of the Odin project
The current project is Recipes in the Foundations course
This project is to build up an HTML foundation.
Once this project is complete, I will have demonstrated the ability to create HTML pages with text, paragraphs, lists, links, and images.
